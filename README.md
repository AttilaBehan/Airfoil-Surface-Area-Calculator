# Airfoil-Surface-Area-Calculator
For TU Delft Group Project Work Package 2 
Code is provided with each airfoil used, and the data of the airfoils is from [airfoiltools](http://www.airfoiltools.com/).
The coordinates are already stripped to be between 0.15c and 0.6c which is where the area is intended to be found (in order to approximate the volume available for fuel).
Coordinates are split into upper and lower surfaces plus the x coordinate and integrated using the trapezium rule.
